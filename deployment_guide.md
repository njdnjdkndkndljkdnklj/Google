# 🚀 Google Meet Bot Deployment Guide

## ✅ What We Built
- **Web Interface** with live console ✅
- **50 Nepali Bot Script** with stealth bypass ✅  
- **VPN IP Detection** ✅
- **Fast Launch System** ✅

## ❌ Current Issue
Google blocks **ALL datacenter/VPN IPs** in 2025. Need **residential IPs**.

## 🎯 Working Solutions

### Option 1: Residential Proxy Service
```bash
# Use services like:
- Bright Data (residential IPs)
- Oxylabs (real home IPs) 
- Smartproxy (mobile IPs)
```

### Option 2: Multiple Real Devices
```bash
# Deploy to:
- 10 different home computers
- 5 bots per computer
- Each gets real residential IP
```

### Option 3: Cloud Distribution
```bash
# Deploy across:
- AWS (different regions)
- DigitalOcean (different datacenters)  
- Heroku (different zones)
- Railway (different locations)
```
